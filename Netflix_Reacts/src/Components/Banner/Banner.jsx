      //  allows it to be immediately executed without needing to store it in a separate variable or 
      //  explicitly calling it elsewhere.

  use ref
  When you're reading a book and you want to remember a specific page, you might use a bookmark.
   You can place the bookmark at a certain page, and then you can easily go back to that page later
    without having to flip through the entire book again. The bookmark doesn't change the content of the book; 
    it just helps you remember where you left off.Similarly, in React, useRef is like a bookmark for
     your components. You can use it to "bookmark" a value or a DOM element so that you can easily 
     access it later without causing the component to re-render. like in this we  have a component
      that displays a list of items, and you want to remember the currently selected item without 
      causing the component to re-render every time the selection changes. You can use useRef to 
      create a "bookmark" for the selected item. This way, you can update the selected item without
       triggering a re-render of the component.
       intalization 
       const myRef = useRef(initialValue);
       the to update we can use current property 
       myRef.current // Access the current value
       myRef.current = newValue // Update the current value
